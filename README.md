# Space Titanic Project
Working as a team we managed to write a neural network predicting chances of survival in a hypothetical space catastrophe. We reached the accuracy of nearly 70%, but did not focus on improving the model as we moved to more interesting tasks.

# Digits Recognition
My own project implementing convolutional neural network to recognize digits from MNIST dataset. In a big part I was following the tutorial from https://nextjournal.com/gkoehler/pytorch-mnist, but I also managed to improve it, speeding it up. I reached the accuracy of 99% after just 3 epochs. The program was used by me as an example of CNN, while I was describing this model class to colleges. 

# Presentations
My own presentations focusing on topic of ML - from linear regression to neural networks.
